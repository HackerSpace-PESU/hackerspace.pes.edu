                HackerSpace is a community-powered Development Club based in PES University, RR Campus which was formed in 2019 by the batch of â€˜22.
                At HackerSpace, we are more than a club. We are a Community.

                The Club aims to inspire peers and create a strong development-oriented community within the campus
                by promoting community powered development.
                <br><br>
                Since we believe in collective growth and participation, all activities are organized by the peers, for the peers.
                We provide a platform for peers to interact with one another and work together to develop applications that can change lives.
                <br><br>
